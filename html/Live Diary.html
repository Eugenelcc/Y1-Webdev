        <p>Peter Pan Heh, Peter Pan Ho !!! . Camp Next Generation was amazing and my first ever camp experience in Nanyang Poly. Camp Next Gen was hosted for students in SIT lasted 3 days 2 nights and the main purpose was to find potentials leaders or team player for the next generation of SIT Exco.</p>
        <p>This is great, I would love to connect others in this camp and as well as joining the excos this year. The theme of this camp was fairy tales and every team is based from fairy tales characters, i was chosen to be in Team Peter Pan together i met my team members <span> KT(Keng Tiong), Pearl ,Johnathon,Valerie,Willy,Jia hui and lastly our Team leader, Kovi </span></P>
        <P> We played various activites and games around the school and bond together as a team.</p>
        <h2> Day 1</h2>
        <p> On the first day, I first step in unknowling everyone and decide to start a conversation with my team , I met Johnathon currently in  class IT1903 he is a friendly guy and apprecate him to be in team Peter pan. The rest start to come later timing.The time we start to talk and bond was when we were eating together and sharing MALA for our lunch. The Mala portion was big and fulfilling which causes me to have a bad stomach ache later on. </p>

        <h2> Day 2 </h2>
        <p> Day 2 was our Water Games Day, I was partially excited for water games but at a same time i forgot to pack an extra pair of pants which ended up me wearing the same pant for 3 days straight. Which is really disgusting but on a bright side i did packed for my undergarments for the camp :D
          <h2>Peter Pan Cheer </h2>

<h2>Day 3 </h2>
<p>Day 3, The last day of the camp next gen we took this time to packup our stuff and prepared down to the auditorium and prepared for announcment for the last activity which is, Love Letter . Love letter is us writing letters to other people who have spent time together with durign the camp and with this letters create memmories for us to reflect back and experience the wonderful times and pains we experience as SIT family .</p>
<p>Whenever i will see these letters i will remember this momment and the time when Peter Pan was not only jsut a fairy tale character but also The Best Team in Camp Next Gen !! </p>
