    <p><i>(This Website is dedicated to my Web Development Assignment)</i> </p>
    <p/>Do you see an asian guy to the right ? That would be me
    <p/>I'm currently a student of Nanyang Polytechnic of Singapore, under the Diploma of Information Technology.
    Honestly this is my first time making a blogsite just to host all of my daily activites and events .
  </P>I enjoy being curious and often seek for adventures which may sometimes end up being misfortune.
  Genuine love to find new friends to keep company and learning from mistakes or new things to enhance my capabilities.

      <p/>I started my education pathway as a normal 4 years old Singaporean kindergarten child would normaly do, which is by attending <a href = "http://www.pcf.org.sg"target="_blank" class="PAPL">PAP Community Foundation </a> also know as <strong>(PAP)</strong> to cultivate and develope my understanding and well-being

        <p/>After my graduation from PCF, I was given the opportunity to study under a new Primary School, <a href = "https://khengcheng.moe.edu.sg" target="_blank" class = "KhengChengL">Kheng Cheng Primary School</a> which is bigger in size then my kindergarten and also Basketball court for the student to play during the free times.
        <p/>To me when i was young , I see my school as a collage faculity.During my time in school I took on other activities and events during my 6 years in this school , I took part in a Co-Curricular Activities (<strong>CCA</strong>) as Frisbee and Floorball
        It is a great experience for me and initially i found floorball to be boring at first but after a few training session and competiton, i found it a competitive sport and enjoyable at the same time.
        <p/>In-terms of my studies, i was not really the best in my class nor the worst, often found myself not balancing my studies and with video games, which affectly neglecting my grades.
